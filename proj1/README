ECEN 602 Network Programming Assignment #1
------------------------------------------

Team number: 24
Team member 1 # Mo Li (UIN:126003824) , develop the client.

Team member 2 # Yiwen Zhang (UIN:425009699) , develop the server.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instruction:

1. open terminal and change the directory where all files resides. Type following command to compile the file.
	
	make 
	
2. To run the server you can write following command in terminal.

	make runServer 

3. To run clients, 
	
	open new terminal and change to the directory where the code is. 

		make runClient1
	
	open new terminal and change to the directory where the code is.

		make runClient2

	open new terminal and change to the directory where the code is. 

		make runClient3

4. To clean up compiled files
	
	make clean
	
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Architecture:

We implemented the server and the client using C.

For client.cpp:

	1. First set up the socket() and connect() to the server.
	2. Input message from keyboard and write to server.
	3. Get message echo from server.
	
For server.cpp
	1. First set up the socket(), bind() it to a port, listen() for connection requests, and accept() them.
	2. Use fork() to create new process.
	3. read message from client and write it back.
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

1. Start the server first with the command line: echos Port, where Port is the port number on which the server is listening. 

2. The client reads a line of text from its standard input and writes the line to the network output to the server.

3. The sever reads the line from its network input and echoes the line back to the client.

4. The client reads the echoed line and prints it on its standard input.

5. The server can support multiple simultaneous connections.

6. When the client reads an EOF(Ctrl + c) from its standard input it closes the socket and exits.
